            <article>
                <p>In 2013 my friend Kelly invited me and my buddy Justin to come vist her in her new home Fort Collins, Colorado.</p>
                <p>I was intially not sure. Taking trips to random places wasn't my thing, but I ignored these intial hesitations and decided to make the journey out there with Justin in October of 2013</p>
                <p>So we set up on our long journey...</p>
