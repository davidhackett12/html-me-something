        <h1>The Greatest Race Run by Anyone Ever</h1>
        <p>There are two kinds of people who talk about their athletic exploits in high school deep into their twenties. The first, obviously, people who were really good at a sport, could have play in college, but didn’t for whatever reason. The second, perhaps less obviously, people who were average athletes but got real into their sport and have lived disappointing lives since. </p>
        <p>I don’t fit into either of those categories precisely. To say I was an average athlete is an insult to average athletes everywhere and I wouldn’t say I’ve lived a disappointing life since high school, I just peaked early. I would argue that I self-actualized around the age of 11: I had already finished my epic novel, could regularly win games on Madden on the all-pro difficulty level, and was an A, B student. Basically everything I felt I needed to accomplish was accomplished by then and so the rest of my life would just be coasting. However much like Philip Roth, who probably thought around the age of seventy-five that his best work was behind him, or Kanye West who thought he’d only ever have success as a producer as it turned out my biggest accomplishment was yet to come. </p>
        <p>When I got to high school and was forced into doing a sport I was a little put off. Luckily I found the last refuge for unmotivated below average athletes: Cross Country. </p>
